When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> When there are multiple contributors and/or devices involved. And when I want to keep
keep all the work somewhere safe.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> It gives better control over what version of repository you want to use and
distinguishes it from other services such as Google Docs and Dropbox.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

-> Forks are clones on Github which maintains connection to parent repository. Clone
simply clones the given repository. Branch is applied to same repo and it stays connectd
to the original repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-> It can be helpful when you want to work offline. The more updated your copy of repo is,
the lesser the chances of conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would
be harder?

-> It would be too messy to collaborate without git. The mess would increase exponentially
with increase in number of contributors.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

-> When we are working with other people we should work on separate branch so that we don't
mess with the master branch that they might have forked from. When we're working privately,
working directly on master can make things a bit simpler.
