When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> When there are multiple contributors and/or devices involved. And when I want to keep
keep all the work somewhere safe.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> It gives better control over what version of repository you want to use and
distinguishes it from other services such as Google Docs and Dropbox.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

-> Forks are clones on Github which maintains connection to parent repository. Clone
simply clones the given repository. Branch is applied to same repo and it stays connectd
to the original repo.
