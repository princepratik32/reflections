What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-> When we initialize a repository, git creates a .git directory with necessary
files to treat the given directory as repository. We need a repository to use
git on a particular directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

-> Staging area is a place where files are put when they need to be committed in
next commit. Files in staging area are not already commited but are the chosen
ones to be committed. It may not include all the files from working directory.
